# 8-Puzzle Solver Game

![8-Puzzle Game Screenshot](screenshot.png)

**About This Project**  
This project is my first game and my first AI project, developed for the AI class at my university.  
It was a valuable learning experience in both game development and artificial intelligence algorithms.

---

A classic 8-puzzle game with AI-powered solving and hint features, built using Python and Pygame.

## üéÆ How to Play

- **Move tiles:** Click on any tile adjacent to the empty space to move it.
- **New Game:** Click "New Game" to shuffle and start a new puzzle.
- **Hint:** Click "Hint" to highlight the best next move (AI suggestion).
- **Solve:** Click "Solve" to watch the AI solve the puzzle automatically.
- **Goal:** Arrange the tiles in order (1-8) with the empty space at the bottom right.

## ü§ñ AI Algorithms

- **Hint:** Uses Greedy Best-First Search to suggest the next best move.
- **Solve:** Uses the A* algorithm with Manhattan Distance heuristic to find the optimal solution path.
